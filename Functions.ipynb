        "In Python, an iterator is an object that allows you to iterate over a sequence of values. An iterator provides two core methods: __iter__() which returns the iterator itself, and __next__() which returns the next value from the sequence. When the sequence is exhausted, the __next__() method should raise a StopIteration exception.\n",

They are created using a function that contains one or more yield statements instead of a return statement. When the generator function is called, it returns a generator object, but none of the function's code is executed immediately. Instead, the code is executed in response to calls to the generator's __next__() method (or the next() function). Each time yield is encountered, the function outputs a value and pauses, maintaining its state, so that execution can be resumed right after the yield statement when __next__() is called again.\n",
